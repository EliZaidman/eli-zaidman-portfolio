**Manos: Land of Bal** is a dark-fantasy **tactical RPG** and my final project at Tiltan.

## My Role

- Led a team of **7 people** (3 developers, 4 artists/designers) as **lead programmer and producer**
- Implemented the **turn-based combat system**, grid selection, and basic enemy AI
- Organized production: task breakdown, priorities, milestones, and builds

## Systems I Built

- **Turn manager** handling initiative order, action points, and turn states
- **Grid targeting** and tile highlighting for movement & abilities
- **Enemy AI** for target selection and behavior patterns
- Ability framework to define skills, damage, and status effects

## Focus Areas

- Making tactical decisions clear and readable (range indicators, highlights)
- Building modular systems that let designers add skills and enemies without code changes
- Coordinating the team so code, art, and design stayed in sync throughout production
