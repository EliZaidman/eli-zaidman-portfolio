ApesTDB is a **mid-core 3D hybrid** combining moment-to-moment shooter gameplay with lane-based tower defense.

## My Role

- Implemented and tuned **core combat controls** (aiming, shooting, movement)
- Built and iterated **UX/UI flows** for menus, HUD, and upgrade systems
- Helped design and balance **enemy waves** and basic AI behaviors
- Integrated **Firebase analytics** events for funnels and player behavior

## Highlights

- Clean, responsive camera and control scheme for mobile 3D shooter gameplay
- Configurable wave system for enemies, allowing designers to tweak difficulty without code
- Structured analytics across the core loop (sessions, upgrades, progression) to support live balancing

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Readability in 3D on mobile**  
  Adjusted camera distance, FOV, enemy silhouettes, and hit VFX so combat stayed readable on small screens.

- **Difficulty curve**  
  Used analytics and internal playtests to find spikes in difficulty, then iterated enemy stats, spawn timing, and player upgrade pacing.

## Tech Stack

- Unity (C#)
- Firebase analytics
- 3D gameplay (camera, movement, combat)
- Mobile UX/UI for mid-core players
