**Cyber Platform** is a first-person **movement platformer** that emphasizes precision, speed, and mastery of the physics.

## My Role

- Designed and implemented the **movement controller** (jump, air control, coyote time)
- Tuned gravity, friction, acceleration, and speed to feel responsive and skill-based
- Co-designed levels around ramps, gaps, wall sections, and precise landing spots

## Mechanics

- Custom jump arc calculations and **coyote-time buffer** to make inputs feel fair
- Momentum-preserving ramps and surfaces that reward smooth lines and flow
- Level layouts that encourage speedrunning and replayability

## Design Goals

- Movement that feels good even when just jumping around in an empty level
- High skill ceiling: players who master the physics can discover new shortcuts and routes
